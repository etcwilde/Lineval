# Fix list
## Due: August 12

 - Correct drawbacks section (my mistake, thought that the heuristic required
   continuous mining, but only validation does)
 - Remove implementation details about python, flaks, and postgresql. (Keep
   information about API -- _maybe?_)
 - More details on bubble tree
 - Replace implementation with validation of heuristic method using continuous
   mining
 - More details and discussion on test cases
 - Expand figure 1, make single-column
 - Specify Master Branch versus Master Repository
 - (If time) Use tikz to replace diagrams
 - More pictures of context panes from gitk
