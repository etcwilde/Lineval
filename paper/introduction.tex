Merge-trees, as presented by Wilde and German\cite{Wilde2016}, are a data structure
designed to make the navigation and summarization of git merges simpler than using
the directed acyclic graph (DAG), as done in gitk among other tools\evan{does this
  need a citation?}. Git uses the DAG model internally, making it simple to
construct tools directly on the DAG;\@ however, this model does not provide a clear
summarization of the events occuring in the repository. Gitk and the git command
line interface (cli) both provide the user with a visualization of the DAG of the
repository.
