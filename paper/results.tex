In this section, we provide the raw aggregated results from the user
study and analysis on those results.

In Table~\ref{tab:conceptual_results}, we are able to see an overview of
the results from the conceptual questions.

  \caption{Results from the conceptual questions}
  \label{tab:conceptual_results}
  \begin{tabular}{ll|r|lrr|rrr}
    Question                      & Commit & Answer & Median & Mean  & Variance & Median(s) & Mean(s) & Variance(s)\\\hline\hline
    Number of commits in the tree & \comA  & 1      & 4      & 19.11 & 753.11   & 10.0      & 49.92   & 5952.08\\
    Number of merges in the tree  & \comA  & 1      & 5      & 8.27  & 53.62    & 7.5       & 24.67   & 884.42\\\hline
    Number of commits in the tree & \comB  & 5      & 4      & 7.80  & 136.84   & 31.5      & 106.83  & 54123.42\\
    Number of merges in the tree  & \comB  & 3      & 3.5    & 5.40  & 50.27    & 11.0      & 65.6    & 29798.82\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Users were able to more closely estimate the number of commits and
merges in the larger tree, but generally took longer than the smaller
tree. The tree with a single node resulted in more variability in the
estimate of number of commits .

It should be noted that these questions were answered after spending
roughly ten minutes attesting to draw a picture that held the answers to
these questions.
