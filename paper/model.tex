\section{Merge-Tree model}
\label{sec:mergetree}

The \mt model abstracts the DAG of the repository into a set of \mt{s}.
Each \mt is rooted at a merge into the master branch. The leaves of this
tree are the commits and the merges are the inner nodes. A \mt is built
recursively with every merge in the \mt merging a sub-\mt. Any merges
that a commit must pass through to reach the master branch become an
inner node of the tree. Effectively, a \mt is a tree that shows the path
that commits follow in their way to the master branch of a repository.
The \mt{s} also help understand how commits were grouped together in
order to be integrated. In this model, not only has the DAG been
inverted (and simplified), but the entire notion of parent-child
relationship has been reversed. Due to this property, the terminology
will be different depending on the model we are referring to; when we
are referring to the \mt, the parent is the next node toward the merge
into the master branch, or the root of the tree. When referring to the
DAG, the parent relationship is in the opposite direction, from the root
toward the branch-point. In addition to identifying the path that a
commit took to being merged, we are able to aggregate the commit
metadata at merges as we retain the parent-child and child-parent
relationship for each event and know which commits belong to the merge.

To illustrate this model we will use a small example: assume the commits
represented in Figure~\ref{fig:repoEvents} show the sequence of events
in a repository. The sequence starts with the initial commit in the
master branch of the master repository at time $t_0$. Repository event 1
is a commit, which gets forked into a separate repository, \textit{Repo
  A}, where another commit is made, event 2. Event 5 is a merge event,
merging event 2, 3, and 4 into \textit{Repo A}. Event 5 is branched
from, commit 6 happens in the new branch, while commit 7 is added
simultaneously to the original branch in \textit{Repo A}. Events 11 and
12 are both merge events, merging changes made in \textit{Repo A} into
the master branch of the master repository. As every repository is a
first-class repository, including local copies and forks, git does not
distinguish between forked repositories and branches, and in neither
case does it explicitly record where a commit was made. In this case,
commits are performed in various repositories and branches. The DAG
representation of these events is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:repoDAG}.

Notice that the DAG loses information about the master branch and the
repository that the master branch is part of. The \mt view of
this DAG is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:repoTree}. Note that the
direction of the edges of the DAG have been inverted, instead of
pointing from the child to the parent, it points from the parent to its
children, forming a path to the master branch. Also note that the DAG
has been simplified, showing only a single edge on the path to master
for any commit.

\subsection{Computing the \mt of the DAG of Linux}

Computing the \mt from a DAG for any repository may not be
possible; however, certain features of the development process of Linux
make it feasible to compute the \mt for the Linux repository.
First, the master branch of Linux is maintained by Linus Torvalds, and
only Linus has write access to it. We have verified this assertion in
previous research~\cite{German2015}. We have developed a heuristic that
is presented in Algorithm~\ref{fig:alg}. In short, the algorithm first
identifies the commits made directly to the master branch, whereafter it
recursively determines the shortest path (in terms of time), using the
DAG, from each commit to the master branch using the inverted DAG.

\begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Computing the \mt of Linux from the DAG}\label{fig:alg}

                \State \quad\quad\quad\quad $\textit{first ancestor until reaching root}$
                \State $nodes(Tree) \gets nodes(DAG)$

                \State {\# Traverse the inverted DAG}
                \For{$c \in children(cid, DAG)$}
                \If {$c \in master$}

                \Else

\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Evaluation}

Merges that do not have conflicts provide information to verify this
heuristic. If a merge does not contain a conflict, it records a summary
of the commits that it merges. See Figure~\ref{fig:sampleMerge} for an
example. This summary contains a list of the first 20 non-merge commits
in the merge, including their one-line log description, and the total
number of non-merge commits in the merge.

        \caption{Example of how merges record a subset of commits being merged. The
                commit only shows the first 20 one-line summaries messages for the 24
                non-merge commits it merged. The ending ``\ldots'' is part of the log
                and represents that other commits were merged.}
        \label{fig:sampleMerge}
\end{figure}

We used this information to evaluate the accuracy of the \mt model
extracted from the DAG\@. The method we followed started with the
extraction of the commit history up to July 20, 2016 form the Linux
repository. We computed the \mtof every commit until that date.
Since Linus Torvalds mostly does merging directly into the master
branch, we assumed that every merge by Linus is the root of a \mt, later
detecting merges that do not merge into the master branch and removing
them from the set of root merges. As described above, the log of a
merge-commit usually contains the number of commits in the merge the
first 20 summaries of commits being merged. We extracted merges by Linus
Torvalds using the command \verb|git log --merges --author='Torvalds'|
and compared the number of commits according to the log with the number
of commits in the \mt rooted in this commit. We also used the summaries
of the commits found in the merge (not necessarily all---see above) to
make sure those commits were in their corresponding \mt For
example, for the merge in Figure~\ref{fig:sampleMerge} we would expect
that the \mt rooted at \mycode{8cbd84f} contains 24 commits, and
the one-line summaries corresponds to commits in that \mt. We also
inspected those with differences to make sure they were true errors. The
results can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}

  \item

    Five merges were false-errors because their logs did not contain
    accurate information (were probably edited by hand). For example in
    \mycode{42a579a0f\ldots} one commit summary was missing (the line was
    empty), in \mycode {c55d267\ldots} the summaries were reordered.

  \item

    The heuristic correctly identified that 79 of Linus merges (between
    Jun 7, 2014 and Jun 2, 2014) were made to a branch (not master).
    This branch was merged at \mycode{3f17ea6d\ldots} which contained 6809
    commits.

  \item

    The heuristic worked perfectly until Sept 4, 2007, the earliest date
    that it could be verified.  Before this date, and until Dec 12,
    2006, merges did not include a summary of the commits they included,
    hence making it impossible to verify; during this period, however,
    we correctly identified the merges by Linus into the master branch.

  \item

    Before Dec. 12, 2006 (1542 merges) our heuristic breaks due to the
    presence of a \foxtrot commit (\mycode{c436688\ldots}),
    which confounded the true master branch.

\end{itemize}

In summary, of the merges after Sept. 4, 2007, our heuristic was correct
in 100\% of the 16,680 commits. It failed in 1,542 commits before Dec.
12, 2006 and in 836 it appears to be correct (Dec 7, 2006 to Sept 4,
2007).
