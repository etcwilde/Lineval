Git uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as its main data model. In this
model, a commit has one or more ordered parents (ancestors), except the
root commits of a repository which do not have ancestors--Linux's git
repository has two such commits.  Commits are divided into merge
commits, merging two or more branches, and non-merge commits. Non-merge
commits have only one parent, while merge commits have two or more. The
order of the parents matter: the first parent is the branch in which the
merge is being done, while the rest indicate the branches being merged
(Git allows merging multiple branches simultaneously). The second parent
is the first branch merged, the third parent is the second branched
merged, etc.

Once a commit is created, it is never changed. Git allows operations to
alter commits or reorder them, but it changes the commit ID in the
process, effectively replacing it with a new commit. This makes commits
unable to record the traversal of merges from the commit to the merge
into the master branch.

A short example: assume the commits represented in
Figure~\ref{fig:repoEvents} show the sequence of events in a repository.
In this case, commits are performed in various repositories and
branches. The DAG representation of the commits is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:repoDAG}. Notice that the DAG loses information about
the master branch and the repository that the master branch is part of.
The merge-tree view of this DAG is visible in Figure~\ref{fig:repoTree}.
Note that the direction of the edges of the DAG have been inverted,
instead of pointing from the child to the ancestors, it points from the
ancestor to its successors, forming a path to the master branch. Also
note that the DAG has been simplified, showing only a single edge on the
path to master for any commit.

\subsection{Computing the merge-tree of the DAG of Linux}

Computing the merge-tree from a DAG for any repository may not be
possible; however, certain features of the development process of Linux
make it feasible to compute the merge-tree for the Linux repository.
First, the master branch of Linux is maintained by Linus Torvalds, and
only Linus has write access to it. We have verified this assertion in
previous research~\cite{German2015}. We have developed a heuristic that
is presented in Algorithm~\ref{fig:alg}. In short, the algorithm first
identifies the commits made directly to the master branch; whereafter it
recursively determines the shortest path (in terms of time), using the
DAG, from each commit to the master branch using the inverted DAG.

\begin{algorithm}
        \caption{Computing the merge-tree of Linux Git's DAG}\label{fig:alg}

                \State $master \gets \textit{traverse DAG from head using }$
                \State \quad\quad\quad\quad $\textit{first ancestor until reaching root}$
                \State $nodes(Tree) \gets nodes(DAG)$
                \State \Function{distance2Master}{cid} : seconds
                \State {\# Helper function}

                \State \Return 0
                \EndIf
                \State    $d \gets 	\infty$
                \State {\# Traverse the inverted DAG}
                \For{$c \in children(cid, DAG)$}
                \If {$c \in master$}
                \State $d_1 \gets commitTime(c)-commitTime(cid)$
                \Else
                \State {$d_1 \gets distance2Master(c)$}
                \EndIf
                \If {$d_1 < d $}
                \State $next \gets c$
                \State  $d \gets d_1$

\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Evaluation}

Merges that do not have conflicts provide information to verify this
heuristic. If a merge does not contain a conflict, it records a summary
of the commits that it merges. See Figure~\ref{fig:sampleMerge} for an
example. This summary contains a list of the first 20 non-merge commits
in the merge, including their one-line log description, the full logs of
the merge commits that merge this subset, and the total number of
non-merge commits in the merge.

        \caption{Example of how merges record a subset of commits being merged. The
                commit only shows the first 20 one-line summaries messages for the 24
                non-merge commits it merged. The ending ``...'' is part of the log
                and represents that other commits were merged.}
        \label{fig:sampleMerge}
\end{figure}



We used this information to evaluate the accuracy of the merge-tree
model extracted from the DAG. The method we followed started with the
extraction of the commit history up to July 20, 2016. We computed the
merge tree of every commit until then. Since Linus Torvalds mostly does
merging directly into master, we assumed that every merge by him is the
root of a merge-tree. As described above, the log of a merge-commit
usually contains the number of commits in the merge the first 20
summaries of commits being merged. We extracted merges by Linus Torvalds
using the command \mycode{log --merges --author='Torvalds} and compared
the number of commits according to the log with the number of commits in
the  merge-tree rooted in this commit. We also used the summaries of the
commits found in the merge (not necessarily all---see above) to make
sure those commits were in their corresponding merge tree. For example,
for the merge in Figure~\ref{fig:sampleMerge} we would expect that the
merge tree rooted at \mycode{8cbd84f} contains 24 commits, and the
one-line summaries corresponds to commits in that merge-tree. We also
inspected those with differences to make sure they were true errors.
The results can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Five merges were false-errors because their logs did not contain accurate information (were probably edited by
  hand). For example in \mycode{42a579a0f...} one commit summary was missing (the line was empty), in \mycode
  {c55d267} the summaries were reordered.
\item The heuristic correctly identified that 79 of Linus merges (between Jun 7, 2014 and Jun 2, 2014) were made to a
  branch (not master). This branch was merged at \mycode{3f17ea6d..} which contained 6809 commits.
\item The heuristic worked perfectly until Sept 4, 2007, the earliest date that it could be verified.
  Before this date, and until Dec 12, 2006, merges did not include a summary of the commits they included, hence making it
  impossible to verify; during this period, however, we correctly identified the merges by Linus into master.
\item Before Dec. 12, 2006 (1542 merges) our heuristic breaks due to the
presence of a \textit{foxtrot} commit (\mycode{c436688...}), which confounded the true master branch of a
repository (see \url{http://bit-booster.blogspot.ca/2016/02/no-foxtrots-allowed.html} for a description of the issue).
\end{itemize}

In summary, of the merges after Sept 4, 2007, in 100\% of them (16,860)
our heuristic was correct. It failed in 1,542 commits before Dec. 12,
2006 and in 836 it appears to be correct (Dec 7, 2006 to Sept 4, 2007).
